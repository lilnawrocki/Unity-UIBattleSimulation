## Description
[itch.io - UI Battle Simulation](https://lilnawrocki.itch.io/ui-battle-simulation)
Password: SmartBear

A UI battle simulation created in Unity using C#, where players can assemble custom teams and engage in turn-based actions like attacking and healing. This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using an interactive UI.

The user can choose up to 3 players and 3 opponents from a shared character pool. Players and enemies can be freely mixed into either group for full flexibility. On the selection screen, the user can preview character stats including HP, MP, and use the Level Up button to boost a character's stats via unique growth curves.

Attack and Heal buttons allow each character to interact with any otherâ€”enemy, ally, or even themselves.
Characters with 0 HP become inactive and cannot be selected or targeted.
Characters can be leveled up during the simulation, but their HP/MP will not increase.

Player Classes:
- Mage
- Swordsman
- Backend Engineer

Enemy Types:
- Pink Bean
- Horny Mushroom
- Slime

Each character class features a unique growth curve, affecting how their stats increase when leveling up.

## Purpose
This project was developed to:

- Demonstrate object-oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Showcase Unity UI programming and event-driven design.
- Offer an interactive demonstration of combat mechanics and character progression logic.

## Inspiration
Player character design is inspired by Suikoden II (classic Japanese RPG).
Enemy design draws from MapleStory (Korean MMORPG).
